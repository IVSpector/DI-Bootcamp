UPDATE film

-- Customer table contain a foreign key from customer.address_id to address.address_id and 
-- it automatically updates customers if the address ID changes
-- you can't delete address that customer still uses

-- You can insert a customer only if the address_id already exists in the address table

-- Yes I can easily drop table customer_review without any consequences
