suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 1: In the `customer_review` table creation, there's a typo: `laguage_id` should be `language_id`.  Also, consider adding indexes to foreign key columns (`film_id`, `language_id`) for improved query performance. The date format '20.01.2006' in the INSERT statement is not standard SQL; use a consistent format like 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
- Exercise 1:  The final DELETE statement and comment are good for demonstrating the ON DELETE CASCADE constraint, but it would improve clarity to explicitly show the effect (e.g., with a SELECT statement after the DELETE to show the row is gone from `customer_review`).
- Exercise 2: The comment explaining foreign key constraints on the `customer` table is accurate but could benefit from a more formal explanation of how referential integrity works and its impact on INSERT and UPDATE operations.
- Exercise 2: The comment about dropping `customer_review` is misleading.  Dropping a table is only easy if no other tables depend on it. Since it has foreign key constraints, dropping it needs confirmation or may fail in some database systems.  A more accurate statement would explain the need for checking dependencies.
- Exercise 2: In the queries for finding the movies, the date format '28.07.2005' is inconsistent.  Use 'YYYY-MM-DD'. The final query for the fourth movie is unnecessarily complex; it can be streamlined.
- General: Use more descriptive aliases in your queries (e.g., instead of `film as film`, use `film as f` or `film as f_lm`). This improves readability. Add comments to explain complex logic sections in the longer queries of Exercise 2.
- General: The code lacks error handling (e.g., checking if INSERT or UPDATE statements succeeded).  In a production environment, this is crucial.
