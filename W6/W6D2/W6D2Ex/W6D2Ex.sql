-- ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Items and customers
-- Instructions
-- We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.

-- Use SQL to get the following from the database:
-- All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).
SELECT *
FROM items
ORDER BY price ASC;

-- Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).
SELECT *
FROM items
WHERE price >= 80
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) â€“ exclude the primary key column from the results.
SELECT 	first_name,
		last_name
FROM customers
ORDER BY first_name ASC
LIMIT 3;

-- All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)
SELECT	last_name
FROM customers
ORDER BY last_name DESC;
