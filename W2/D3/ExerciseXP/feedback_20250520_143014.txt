suggestions for improvement:
- In the Currency class, the `get_amount` method could be simplified. It unnecessarily checks for both `int` and `Currency` types within the same method.  Separate methods for adding integers and Currency objects would improve readability and maintainability.
- The `plural_single` method in the Currency class can be simplified using conditional expressions.
- In Exercise 3, there's no need to pre-calculate `a`.  `random.choice` can be used directly on `all_letters`.
- Exercise 5's `new_year_is` function has a mistake in the `datetime.strptime` format string.  `%M` is for minutes, not month. It should be `%m`.
- Exercise 7's `generate_users` function unnecessarily uses a `while` loop and `new_user.clear()`. A more efficient approach is to directly append a new dictionary in each loop iteration.
- Add error handling (try-except blocks) where appropriate to gracefully handle potential errors, such as incorrect date formats from the user in Exercise 6.
