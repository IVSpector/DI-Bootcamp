suggestions for improvement:
- The Exercise 1 answers are good, but could benefit from being more concise and avoiding redundancy (e.g., combining the explanations of inheritance and multiple inheritance).
- In the `Deck` class, consider adding error handling (e.g., a more informative message) for the `deal` method when the deck is empty.
- The code lacks docstrings explaining the purpose of each class and method which would improve readability.
