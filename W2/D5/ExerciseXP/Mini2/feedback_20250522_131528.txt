suggestions for improvement:
- The `item_dict` method in the `Game` class could be made more efficient by using a dictionary directly instead of a function.
- Add more robust input validation in `get_user_menu_choice` to handle unexpected input more gracefully. For example, handle non-integer input and input outside the range of menu options.
- The `rock-paper-scissors.py` file is missing, which is a crucial part of the project, impacting the overall functionality and the user experience.
- Consider adding error handling (e.g., try-except blocks) around user input in `get_user_item` to prevent the program from crashing due to unexpected input.
- Improve the user interface. Provide clear instructions and informative messages to guide the user through the game effectively.
- Add score tracking to the `main` function in `rock-paper-scissors.py` to persist the user's wins, losses, and draws across multiple game rounds. This requires implementing the `results` dictionary and updating it after each game.
- Add a function to display the current score to the user during the gameplay for increased engagement and feedback.
- Use more descriptive variable names (e.g., `user_choice` instead of `user_turn`, `computer_choice` instead of `computer_turn`).
- The comments in the code are too sparse. Add more comments to explain the logic and the purpose of different parts of the code, enhancing the readability and maintainability.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `game.py` file is missing, preventing a complete assessment of the game logic.  The provided code only covers the menu and results handling in `rock-paper-scissors.py`.
- Error handling in `get_user_menu_choice` could be improved by using a `try-except` block to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions more gracefully if the user enters non-numeric input.
- The `results` dictionary is a global variable.  It's generally better practice to pass it as an argument to functions to improve code clarity and maintainability. 
- Add more robust input validation in `get_user_menu_choice` to handle unexpected input (e.g., empty strings, non-digit characters).
